            Most of us want an honest relationship with our spouse. But some people have a need for honesty and openness â it gives them a sense of security and helps them become emotionally bonded to the one who meets that need.  Those with a need for honesty and openness want accurate information about their spouses&#39; thoughts, feelings, habits, likes, dislikes, personal history, daily activities and plans for the future. If their spouse does not provide honest and open communication, trust is undermined and the feelings of security can eventually be destroyed. They cannot trust the signals that are being sent and feel they have no foundation on which to build a solid relationship. Instead of adjusting, they feel off balance; instead of growing together, they feel as if they are growing apart.
    
            Honesty and openness helps build compatibility in marriage. When you and your spouse openly reveal the facts of your past, your present activities, and your plans for the future, you are able to make intelligent decisions that take each other&#39;s feelings into account. And that&#39;s how you create compatibility â by making decisions that work well for both of you simultaneously.
            
            But aside from the practical considerations of honesty and openness, those with this need feel happy and fulfilled when their spouses reveal their most private thoughts to them, and feel very frustrated when they are hidden. That reaction is evidence of an emotional need, and if that is the way you feel, include honesty and openness as one of your most important emotional needs.

            We are working to increase representation on a large-scale, and we have found that mentorship offers an immediate and individual solution that allows high school girls to connect with personal role models. Often older and successful role models seem elusive in their nature as they&#39;re just slightly distant from our situation. Through matching high school girls with college students, we&#39;re fostering positive contact with realistic and tangible role models.At Lab, the founding chapter, in the first year, we had 66 participants, resulting in 33 pairs of mentors and mentees. They were all matched based on similar interests and personalities that were indicated on forms that we sent out to both parties. Through consistent monitoring in the following months, we received positive feedback that exceeded our expectations and informed our practices at other chapters and for the coming years.The mentorships vary on a case by case basis, so the advice can range. We left it open-ended so that each partnership could find what worked best for them. Mentor/mentee partnerships generally meet in coffee shops, cafÃ©s, or other informal locations once to four times a quarter. This allows for a casual and mutually beneficial relationship to flourish.

            I was seven when Ruth Bader Ginsburg pressed to pass into law the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that allowed me, as a woman, to apply for credit cards and mortgages without a male co-signer. I was 40 when Bader Ginsburg helped ensure women get equal pay. I was five when she argued to gain protection for pregnant women in the workplace. These are all privileges that I have taken for granted. I have very rarely (never) thought about the women who fought to allow me access to these ideals that allow me to be independent.
    
    Where would my life be now if it werenât for these privileges and these freedoms? As hard as she fought, consider how many women fought against her. I can imagine that Bader Ginsburg experienced much backlash throughout her years as a judge, a leader and as a woman.
    
    After her death, weâve heard many wonderful things about her and about what she bravely accomplished on our behalf. But think about how many times she was torn apart, pushed down and verbally shredded. She constantly picked herself up, brushed herself off and went back to fight the fight.
    
    I have seen this happen to women at all levels in government and in business. I have been on the receiving end of this and, to be totally candid, Iâve been on the other side too. I am aware of this and continually self-reflect on how I can do better.
