    <p>
     The best present one can hope for this year is to spend time together. I can't wait to celebrate Christmas with you.
        What can be better than opening presents, eating food and singing Christmas music. Doing all those things with family like you.
        Best wishes to you and your family this Christmas. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Another year has passed us by and we hope that you and yours have a wonderful Christmas and get everything you wish for.
        Merry Christmas to you and the kids! Hope it's a fun one with minimal stress .

    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>
        It's the most wonderful time of the year! It's easy to get lost in the flurry of activity during Christmas time. May you get chance to take in the beauty and true meaning of the season and have a Merry Christmas!
        Tis the season to be jolly! Have yourself a Merry little Christmas, let your heart be light. May this Christmas season bring you closer to all those that you treasure in your heart. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New year!
        I hope Santa is good to you this year because you only deserve the best. Merry Christmas from our family to yours. Take nothing for granted and be thankful that you have such great family and friends to spend this joyous season with. Wishing you a delightful Christmas.
        Wishing you and your family health, happiness, peace and prosperity this Christmas and in the coming New Year.

    <h2>Section Three</h2>
    <p>
        Yule always be my favourite. Why did Santa quit smoking? Because it was bad for his elf.
        Christmas is a very spiritual time - In your case vodka, gin and whisk.  Yay! It's Christmas! Let's buy loads of stuff no one needs!
        Whoever said 'all is calm' has never been to our house around Christmas. Some might say we're not very bright, either.  I only got you a card in case you got me one...
        You can tell a lot about a person by the way they handle three things: a rainy day, lost luggage and tangled Christmas tree lights.
        I hope you like the present you told me to buy for you.
